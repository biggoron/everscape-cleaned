################ Building of sqlite database ##############
-> db_scripts.py builds the skeleton of the sqlite database
-> _builder.py files read the csv_everscape folder (exported
	from mysql db), to fill the sqlite db
~> Be aware that the handling of redundant and inconsistent
   data is far from trivial:
	->same timestamp but different position
	->same rows (mysql had a row id)
	->not unitary data
	->inconsistent data
-> creates everscape.db sqlite database, used afterward 
   for feature extraction
###########################################################

Note that the built database will be modified afterward as we
store more features. Additional features will be stored in
distinct tables.

To understand the processing and storage of data, please see
the commentaries in the script files, or the documentation of
the database.

README: TO BUILD THE DATABASE
run the db_script.py script
run the session_builder.py (before other builders)
run the avatar_builder.py
run the position_builder.py
run the car_spawns_builder.py

Note: each one of the builder cleans the tables it uses 
in database. no need to rerun db_script.py to do some
cleaning.
